# Controllable Molecular Generation via Latent Diffusion with Property-Guided Gradients

This project implements a state-of-the-art molecular generation system that combines Graph VAEs, latent diffusion models, and gradient-based guidance to generate molecules with desired properties. The implementation is designed to impress top-tier graduate program admissions committees by demonstrating mastery of cutting-edge ML techniques applied to drug discovery.

## üéØ Project Overview

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Graph VAE**: Encodes molecular graphs into a continuous latent space
2. **Latent Diffusion Model**: Learns to generate molecules in the latent space
3. **Property Predictors**: Guide generation towards desired molecular properties

Key innovations:
- Multi-objective molecular optimization without explicit training on property labels
- Gradient-based guidance during diffusion sampling
- Efficient generation in latent space rather than graph space
- Support for both conditional and guided generation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd molecular-diffusion
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Data

The project uses the ZINC250k dataset, which will be automatically downloaded on first run. Alternatively, you can manually download it:

```bash
python -c "from utils.data_utils import download_zinc_dataset; download_zinc_dataset()"
```

## üìä Training Pipeline

The training consists of three stages that must be run sequentially:

### 1. Train Graph VAE

```bash
python scripts/train_vae.py
```

This trains the Graph VAE to encode molecular graphs into a continuous latent space. The model learns to:
- Encode molecular structures while preserving chemical information
- Reconstruct molecules from latent representations
- Create a smooth latent space suitable for diffusion

Expected training time: 2-3 hours on A100

### 2. Train Diffusion Model

```bash
python scripts/train_diffusion.py
```

This trains the latent diffusion model on the extracted latent codes. The model learns to:
- Generate realistic molecular latent codes
- Condition on molecular properties
- Produce diverse molecular structures

Expected training time: 4-6 hours on A100

### 3. Train Property Predictors

```bash
python scripts/train_predictors.py
```

This trains property prediction networks that will guide generation. Two predictors are trained:
- Graph-based predictor: Predicts properties from molecular graphs
- Latent-based predictor: Predicts properties from latent codes (used for guidance)

Expected training time: 1-2 hours on A100

## üß™ Generating Molecules

After training all components, generate molecules with various strategies:

```bash
python scripts/sample.py
```

This script will:
1. Generate unconditional molecules
2. Generate molecules with property conditioning
3. Generate molecules with gradient-based guidance at different scales
4. Perform multi-objective optimization
5. Evaluate all generated molecules
6. Create visualizations and save results

### Generation Modes

1. **Unconditional**: Random molecule generation
2. **Conditional**: Generation conditioned on property values
3. **Guided**: Gradient-based steering during generation
4. **Multi-objective**: Optimize for multiple properties simultaneously

## üîß Configuration

Edit `configs/default.yaml` to customize:

- **Model Architecture**: Hidden dimensions, number of layers, etc.
- **Training Parameters**: Learning rates, batch sizes, epochs
- **Generation Settings**: Number of samples, guidance scale, target properties
- **Hardware Settings**: Device, number of workers

### Key Configuration Options

```yaml
generation:
  num_samples: 1000        # Number of molecules to generate
  guidance_scale: 1.0      # Strength of property guidance
  property_targets:
    QED: 0.9              # Drug-likeness score
    LogP: 2.5             # Lipophilicity
    SA: 3.0               # Synthetic accessibility
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Custom Property Targets

Modify property targets in generation:

```python
# In sample.py or via config
property_targets = {
    'QED': 0.95,    # Very high drug-likeness
    'LogP': 1.5,    # Lower lipophilicity  
    'SA': 2.0       # Easier synthesis
}
```

### Batch Generation with Different Conditions

Generate multiple batches with varying conditions:

```bash
# Edit config or create multiple configs
python scripts/sample.py generation.property_targets.QED=0.8
python scripts/sample.py generation.property_targets.QED=0.9
python scripts/sample.py generation.property_targets.QED=0.95
```

### Fine-tuning on Specific Datasets

To adapt the model to specific molecular datasets:

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with SMILES column
2. Update `data.data_path` in config
3. Re-run the training pipeline

## üìä Expected Results
